# SplitWiseSystemDesign
System Design for Splitwise

Functionalities:
1. User can split spend with another user
- Based on percentage
- Absolute values
- Equally

2. User can split spend with a group
3. User can exclude few people from the group while adding expense
4. User can simplify debts - A owes money to B, B owes money to C. If B chooses to simplify debts, then A will pay to C directly

Future plan: User can export their monthly summary of expenses and dues

Extensible, modular and clean code
Choice of data structure was important for extensibility of the code. Took some time to think through it.
Started working from the first requirement and modelled other requirementson top of it.
